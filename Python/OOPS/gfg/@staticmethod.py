# When function decorated with @staticmethod is called, we donâ€™t pass an instance of the class to it as it is normally done with methods.
# It means that the function is put inside the class but it cannot access the instance of that class.
# It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance (e.g. C().f()). 
# Both the class and the instance are ignored, and neither is passed implicitly as the first argument to the method.
